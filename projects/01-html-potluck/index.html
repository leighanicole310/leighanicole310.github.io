            If I could only make one pasta dish for the rest of my life, it 
            would have to be these stuffed pasta shells! Imagine we took Cajun 
            Pasta and combined it with Alfredo Pasta, added shrimp, and then 
            this recipe was born. It has everything you could want in the 
            perfect pasta dish!

            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <p>
                <b>SHRIMP FILLING</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large pan over medium heat.
                    <li>Add olive oil, butter, diced bell peppers, shrimp,  
                        chili powder, salt, paprika, garlic powder, 
                        onion powder, oregano, and cayenne powder.
                    <li>Mix together and saute for 7 to 9 minutes until the 
                        shrimp is cooked and the peppers have seared 
                        and softened.
                    <li>Remove the shrimp and pepper filling from the pan and 
                        to the same pan, we will make the sauce.
                </ol>
                <b>CAJUN ALFREDO SAUCE</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, melt down the butter 
                        with the garlic. Saute for a minute or two.
                    <li>Add the heavy cream, cajun seasoning, dried basil, 
                        salt, and black pepper. Whisk together and bring to 
                        a simmer for 5 to 6 minutes to reduce and thicken.
                    <li>Add the parmesan, cream cheese, and a small squeeze 
                        of lemon juice. Whisk again until the sauce is smooth 
                        and thick.
                    <li>Take off the heat, add the chopped parsley, mix again, 
                        and set aside.
                </ol>
                <b>COOK PASTA AND ASSEMBLE</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large pot of water to a boil. Once it comes to a 
                        boil, generously salt your water. Then drop the pasta 
                        shells in and cook according to package directions to 
                        al dente. Drain and dry the shells before filling.
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.
                    <li>To the bottom of a large oven-safe baking dish, add 
                        about 1 cup of the cajun alfredo sauce to cover 
                        the bottom.
                    <li>Fill each jumbo shell with shrimp filling and arrange 
                        in rows in a large oven-safe baking dish.
                    <li>Pour the remaining cajun alfredo sauce on top of the 
                        shells, adding as little or as much sauce as you'd like.
                        I suggest not filling it with sauce to the top. 
                        That way the pasta shells can crisp up in the oven.
                    <li>Sprinkle the top with cheese, cover the dish with foil, 
                        and pop in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.
                    <li>Uncover, turn the oven setting to broil, and cook for 
                        another 3 to 4 minutes until the top is golden brown 
                        and crispy. Monitor closely as it can burn quickly.
                    <li>Take out of the oven and garnish with parsley, red 
                        pepper flakes, and more parmesan if desired.

            Greek food meets Mexican food in this fusion recipe combining the 
            flavors of both cuisines into one taco! We all know and love 
            parmesan-crusted tortillas but what about a crispy feta crust? 
            It’s salty and tangy and pairs so well with the flavors of 
            chipotle chicken!

                <b>MAKE THE CHICKEN</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>To a large bowl, add the chicken, olive oil, 
                        adobo paste, chili powder, garlic, salt, coriander,

                        Once it's hot, add a drizzle of oil to the pan.

                    <li>Once hot, add about 2 tablespoons of crumbled feta
