            Italy! It’s rich and decadent and has all the flavors of the classic

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>FOR ASSEMBLY</b>
            <ul>
                <li>2 packages ladyfingers, 7 ounces each
                <li>1 1/2 cup cold espresso
                <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar
             </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
            <b>PREPARE THE CREAM FILLING</b>
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks 
                and sugar until thickened and lighter in color.
                <li>In a separate large mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream and 
                vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.
                <li>Gently fold the mascarpone cheese into the egg yolk mixture 
                until smooth and creamy.
                <li>Gradually fold in the whipped cream until the mixture is 
                well combined and creamy. Be gentle to maintain the fluffy 
                texture.
            </ul>    
            <b>PREPARE THE LADYFINGERS</b>
            <ul>    
                <li>In a shallow dish, mix the cold espresso with the brown 
                sugar until the sugar is dissolved.
                <li>Dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture for a few 
                seconds, ensuring they are soaked but not soggy.
                
            </ul>
            <b>ASSEMBLE THE TIRAMISU CUPS</b>        
            <ul>    
                <li>In individual serving cups or glasses, place a layer of 
                soaked ladyfingers at the bottom.
                <li>Spoon a layer of the cream filling over the ladyfingers, 
                spreading it evenly.
                <li>Repeat the layers, alternating between soaked ladyfingers 
                and cream filling until the cups are filled, ending with a 
                layer of cream on top.
            </ul>
            <b>CHILL AND SERVE</b>
            <ul>    
                <li>Cover the tiramisu cups with plastic wrap and refrigerate 
                for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow the flavors 
                to meld and the dessert to set.
                <li>Before serving, you can dust the tops with cocoa powder 
                or grated chocolate for decoration if desired.
                <li>Serve chilled and enjoy your delicious individual 
                tiramisu cups!
