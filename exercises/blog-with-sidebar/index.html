                <p>
                    The sequel to a film that captivated many with its wisdom 
                    about emotions is already a hit at the box office. Disney 
                    and Pixar’s Inside Out 2 debuted Friday and earned about 
                    $213 million Cdn in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over the 
                    weekend, according to The Associated Press. That makes it 
                    the second-biggest opening weekend in history for an 
                    animated film, behind the 2018 film Incredibles 2. But the 
                    film isn’t just fun summer entertainment — according to one 
                    mental health expert, there’s a lot kids can take away from 
                    it about how to manage their emotions.

                    The original Inside Out is about an 11-year-old girl named 
                    Riley who has to learn how to manage her emotions as her 
                    family moves away from all her friends. The film depicts 
                    those emotions — Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust — 
                    as animated characters that Riley can interact with and 
                    learn from. In the new film, Riley is back, but now that 
                    she’s a little bit older, she’s experiencing four new 
                    emotions: Anxiety: A nervousness about something bad or 
                    uncertain happening in the future. Embarrassment: A feeling 
                    that you’ve done something incorrect or wrong that makes 
                    you want to retreat. Envy: A longing for something someone 
                    else has, like a material possession or a characteristic 
                    about them. Ennui: Put simply, boredom. In a statement to 
                    CBC Kids News, Pixar said it included the four new emotions 
                    because they represent the type of self-consciousness that 
                    comes with puberty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, “embarrassment involves worrying about someone 
                    else's opinion [and] envy happens when we question why 
                    others have skills or material objects that we want for 
                    ourselves,” said psychologist Lisa Damour, who was a
                    consultant for the film. Jake Coyle, a film critic with 
                    The Associated Press, said the film deserves praise for 
                    taking on important topics and ideas, including anxiety — 
                    something highly relevant to the teens of today. “The care 
                    is taken here to illustrate how new impulses can run 
                    roughshod over a young person and throw their internal 
                    compass out of whack,” he wrote.

                    In order to process our emotions, we first need to know 
                    what emotion we’re experiencing. But as kids get older and 
                    enter puberty, emotions can get more complex and harder to 
                    identify, says clinical psychologist Kristel Thomassin. In 
                    Inside Out 2, Riley’s nine emotions live in her brain and 
                    guide her as she heads off to hockey camp. (Image credit: 
                    Disney/Pixar) That’s what she likes about the Inside Out 
                    series, she says — it gives our emotions a character and a 
                    face, which could help teach kids how to better recognize 
                    what they’re feeling. “Once we know what emotion we’re 
                    feeling, we can get information from it,” said Thomassin. 
                    “Emotions are clues.” For example, if your mom were to take 
                    away your phone because of a bad grade, you may get angry 
                    and have a tantrum — which probably won’t get you anywhere.
                    Instead, you could pause and see if that anger is clueing 
                    you into something. Maybe it’s a clue that you have a need 
                    that isn’t being met. Perhaps it’s the need for social 
                    interaction that you usually get from texting your friends.
                    Instead of lashing out at your mom, you could instead plan 
                    to hang out with friends in person in order to meet that 
                    need in a different way. With that said, regulating our 
                    emotions takes many years of practice. And it’s also 
                    possible to experience many emotions at once, Thomassin 
                    says. “It’s quite challenging, in these years, to be able 
                    to differentiate emotions and feel all of those feelings,” 
                    she said.

                    It’s important to learn how to process our emotions, but 
                    Thomassin said our society sometimes focuses too much on 
                    “dealing with” or extinguishing them right away. For 
                    example, a friend breakup can be devastating, and the 
                    emotions that come with it may take days or weeks to 
                    accept and process. “Sometimes it’s important to allow 
                    yourself the space to feel those emotions, and that can be 
                    helpful,” she said. When you’re going through a difficult 
                    time like that, it’s important to check in with yourself 
                    every once in a while and ask: Is experiencing this emotion 
                    still helpful? “If the emotion is feeling worse and worse 
                    to the point where you no longer want to go to school, 
                    that’s not helpful,” she said. At that point, it may be 
                    time to take a different approach to process the emotion. 
                    One of those ways can be talking to a trusted adult or an 
                    anonymous service like Kids Help Phone. Here’s how you can 
                    get in contact with them.
